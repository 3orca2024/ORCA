  <h2>Major Characters — Expanded, Test‑Ready Summaries</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Theseus</div>
    <p>Theseus is the Duke of Athens and represents law, order, and rational thinking. He believes rules and authority are necessary to keep society stable, which is why he initially supports Egeus’ demand that Hermia marry Demetrius. However, by the end of the play, Theseus becomes more flexible, suggesting that reason alone is not enough without compassion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Hippolyta</div>
    <p>Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, is engaged to Theseus and serves as a quiet contrast to him. She is thoughtful, observant, and more emotionally aware, often questioning Theseus’ strict judgments. Her reactions show that understanding and empathy are just as important as authority.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Hermia</div>
    <p>Hermia is strong‑willed, passionate, and independent. She refuses to marry Demetrius despite the law, proving her loyalty to Lysander and her belief in true love. Hermia represents resistance to unfair authority and shows that love should be chosen, not forced.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Lysander</div>

  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Helena</div>
    <p>Helena is deeply insecure and believes love must involve pain and humiliation. She idolizes Demetrius despite his cruelty and constantly compares herself to Hermia. Her character highlights how low self‑esteem distorts love and judgment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Oberon</div>
    <p>Oberon, King of the Fairies, controls magic and the natural world. Although he aims to restore balance, he often uses manipulation to achieve his goals. His actions show that power, even when used with good intentions, can cause harm.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Titania</div>
    <p>Titania is proud, independent, and fiercely protective. Her refusal to obey Oberon disrupts nature itself, emphasizing the importance of balance. Her enchantment demonstrates how loss of control leads to humiliation and disorder.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="character-name">Puck (Robin Goodfellow)</div>
    <p>Puck is mischievous, playful, and careless. He enjoys chaos and often causes problems through mistakes rather than malice. Puck represents the unpredictability of life and reminds the audience not to take events too seriously.</p>

  <h2>Five-Paragraph Model Responses (Teacher-Level Answers)</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Who Was William Shakespeare and Why Is He Important?</h3>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 1 (Introduction):</strong> William Shakespeare was one of the most influential writers in English literature. Born in 1564 during the English Renaissance, he wrote plays that explored human behavior, emotion, and conflict. His importance lies not only in his storytelling but in his ability to combine entertainment with deeper meaning.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 2 (Early Life):</strong> Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he likely received a grammar school education focused on Latin and classical texts. This education influenced his later writing, as many of his plays reference mythology, Roman history, and classical ideas.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 3 (Career):</strong> As an adult, Shakespeare moved to London and became both an actor and a playwright. He joined the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later known as the King’s Men, which gave him royal support and financial stability.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 4 (Theater Impact):</strong> Shakespeare wrote for public theaters like the Globe, meaning his plays had to appeal to all social classes. This explains his use of humor, dramatic language, and relatable characters.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 5 (Conclusion):</strong> Shakespeare remains important because his works continue to reflect universal themes such as love, power, and identity. His ability to blend comedy with serious ideas allows his plays to remain relevant today.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why Is <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> a Comedy?</h3>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> is classified as a comedy because it follows the traditional structure of Shakespearean comedy. The play begins with conflict and confusion but ends with harmony and marriage.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> One reason the play is comedic is its use of mistaken identity and magical interference. Love potions cause characters to fall in love with the wrong people, creating humorous misunderstandings.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> The mechanicals add physical comedy and exaggeration. Their overly dramatic performance of <em>Pyramus and Thisbe</em> mocks serious tragic plays.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> The presence of fairies and magic increases the play’s absurdity. Characters behave irrationally, highlighting the foolishness of love.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 5:</strong> Ultimately, the play is a comedy because order is restored, conflicts are resolved, and multiple couples are married, creating a joyful conclusion.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Athens vs. The Forest: Why Setting Matters</h3>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> Shakespeare uses Athens and the forest to represent two opposing worlds. Athens symbolizes law, order, and reason, while the forest represents chaos and emotion.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> In Athens, characters are controlled by strict laws, particularly concerning marriage and obedience. These rules create conflict, especially for Hermia.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> The forest allows characters to escape these laws. Magic disrupts normal behavior, leading to confusion and transformation.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> While the forest causes chaos, it also allows characters to discover their true feelings. Mistakes made there help resolve conflicts.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 5:</strong> When characters return to Athens, order is restored, but they are changed. Shakespeare suggests that balance between reason and emotion is necessary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How Shakespeare Uses Love to Reveal Character</h3>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> In <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, love is portrayed as unpredictable and irrational. Shakespeare uses romantic conflict to reveal character traits.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> Hermia’s love shows her strength and independence. She defies authority to follow her heart.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> Helena’s love exposes insecurity and self-doubt. She believes she must suffer to be loved.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> Demetrius and Lysander demonstrate how easily love can change, especially when influenced by magic.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 5:</strong> Through these relationships, Shakespeare suggests that love lacks logic and must be balanced by reason.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Why Puck Is a Significant Character</h3>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> Puck plays a major role in the development of conflict and comedy in the play.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> As Oberon’s servant, Puck carries out magical tasks that directly affect the lovers.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong> His mistakes cause confusion, highlighting the unpredictable nature of magic.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong> Puck’s humor and commentary provide insight into the foolishness of humans.</p>
    <p><strong>Paragraph 5:</strong> At the end, Puck addresses the audience directly, reinforcing the theme of dreams versus reality.</p>
